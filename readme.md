Anonymous reviews about your organization.

### How Review Submission Works
To ensure all reviews are authentic, we require the link to your LinkedIn profile.

Your review will be approved if a specific number of anonymous verifiers confirm that you are a current or former employee of the organization.

### How Identity Verification Works
Every review submitter also acts as a verifier.

To submit a review, you must first verify the identity of at least one random user. 

We will provide you with a LinkedIn profile and the name of their organization. You need to visit the LinkedIn profile and confirm whether the person is genuine and belongs to the stated organization.

A review is approved or rejected based on a specific number of positive or negative verifications.
